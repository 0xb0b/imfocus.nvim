focus:
- iterate over lines from top to bottom of the screen to get ranges of text
  nvim_buf_get_lines(start, end, is_strict)
    0-based indexing
  color and change color
    line number: 1-based
    column number: from 1 to col("$") - 1, 1-based
      col() returns byte position
    colors: synIDattr(synIDtrans(synID(<line num>, <col num>, 1)), "fg/bg")
      is col a screen position or byte position?
      weird: if a character is not a whitespace and synID is 0 this is Normal
             highlight group;
             if normal text is highlighted (by search for example) the synID
             is still 0!
      ! Warning: This function can be very slow.
    range: (start col, syntax id)
      change color
        get highlighting group from the cache or add if not found (string set)
          key: const name + hash of (color + lightness)
            lightness: integer from 0 to max, 0 - Normal bg, max - color
              max + 1 = 16 is enough number of shades?
            lightness is calculated based on the distance to the focused region
            and settings
        matchaddpos(highlight group, [line, col, length])
          line and col are 1-based, col and length in bytes
    optimization:
      store ranges in the cache
        key: hash of (line string + colorscheme)
        value: list of ranges

unfocus:
- clear highlights added by matchaddpos()
    matchdelete(id)
